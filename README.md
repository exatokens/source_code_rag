the goal of this project is to create a search system where user can ask questions for a given repo. for this we are building a rag for a given github or bitbucket repo. and we can also configure the llm. so when we ask a question we get the closest code for the question, retrieve all the functions , classes or any sources related to that and feed it to llm to get generative answers. this should be language agnostic.
